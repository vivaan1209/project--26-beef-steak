# Mix together mustard, garlic and onion powder. Then mix in remaining ingredients.
# Place beef in a ziplock bag with Marinade and marinade overnight (12 - 24 hours).
# Remove from the fridge 30 minutes before cooking to bring to room temperature - key for even cooking of steaks. Shake off excess marinade.
# Brush BBQ Grills with oil, then heat on high heat until is really hot - you should see wisps of smoke. Or heat a heavy based skillet on high until very hot, then add oil - it will heat almost instantly.
# Add steaks. For 2cm / 3/4" thick steaks, cook the first side for 2 minutes, then turn and cook the other side for 2 minutes (medium rare 52°C/125°F, chart below for other doneness temps). (Note 3)
# Remove from skillet onto a WARM plate, cover loosely with foil and set aside for 5 minutes.
# Serve! I couldn't resist garlic butter - see recipe in notes.
